ObjectWriter is a simple Python code editor and writer developed by Zohan Haque using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a lightweight and user-friendly environment for writing Python code with essential features for editing and saving files. Although it is not a fully advanced IDE, it offers everything needed for basic Python development.

## Features

- Lightweight Python code editor
- Built with Python's Tkinter library for the GUI
- Basic features for editing and saving Python files
- Code preview functionality
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 7,Vista or later
- **Python**: Version 3.x (Python 3.6 or higher recommended)

## Installation

1. Download the ObjectWriter setup file from the [MSI File](https://github.com/ZohanHaqu/ObjectWriter/releases/download/1.0/ObjectWriter.msi).
2. Run the setup and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, launch ObjectWriter and start writing your Python code!

## Compile Feature

Please note that sometimes the "Compile" feature may not work as expected. If you encounter issues, it could be due to a lack of access to ObjectWriter's program files directory. There might be a chance that a portable package will be released in the future to address this issue.
